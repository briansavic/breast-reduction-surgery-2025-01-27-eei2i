                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Breast reduction surgery, technically known as reduction mammoplasty, is a transformative procedure that helps women achieve a more proportionate breast size while alleviating physical discomfort and emotional challenges associated with overly large breasts. This comprehensive guide will explore every aspect of the procedure, from initial consultation to full recovery.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">For many women, the decision to undergo breast reduction surgery comes after years of dealing with physical symptoms such as neck pain, shoulder strain, and back discomfort. Beyond the physical benefits, the procedure can significantly improve quality of life, self-confidence, and ability to participate in physical activities.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Pre-Surgical Planning</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Your surgeon will carefully mark the new position of the nipple and areola, and outline the tissue to be removed. This planning ensures optimal results and symmetry.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The most common technique involves three incisions: around the areola, vertically down to the breast crease, and horizontally along the breast crease. Through these incisions, excess breast tissue, fat, and skin are removed, and the nipple and areola are repositioned.</p>
